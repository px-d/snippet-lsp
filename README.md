# Snippet LSP

a super simple and primitive lsp implementation to add custom snippets to every editor that supports lsp's


## TODOs:
- [ ] Read snippet path from env (use fallback)
- [ ] ^- if that is done, maybe add functionality to have language specific snippets but only one lsp (again, an env-var would trigger separation)
